	abstract = {Bacterial colony enumeration has applications in many different assays such as antibiotic screening, toxicology testing, and genotoxicity measuring. The counting of bacterial colony is usually performed by well-trained technicians manually. However, this manual enumeration process has a very low throughput, and is time consuming and labor intensive in practice. To provide consistent and accurate results and improve the throughput, the existing colony counter devices and software were then developed and commercialized in the market. In this study, we propose a fully automatic colony counter and compare its performance with Clono-Counter, an existing automatic colony counter reported by Niyazi et al. Our proposed method can significantly reduce the manual labor by automatically detecting the dish/plate region and extracting and counting colonies. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms Clono-Counter in terms of Precision, Recall, and F-measures.},

	abstract = {This work establishes an objective method to measure cell clonogenic survival by computer-assisted image processing using images of cell cultures fixed and stained in Petri dishes. The procedure, developed by Samba Technologies, consists of acquiring Petri dish pictures with a desktop scanner and analysing them by computer, using algorithms based on the 'top hat' filter. The results from the automated count for the cell line {SQ20B} are compared with those found by two observers, before and after normalization of the counting. After normalization, the shape of the survival curves of the 'manual' counting of the Petri dishes shows a good correlation between both observers. The software enables the small visible differences in count between observers to be eliminated. The comparison between the absolute number of colonies shows an increased difference between the two manual scorings that can be as great as 67 colonies, whereas the difference between the two automated counts is never greater than 8 colonies. These results demonstrate that the 'manual' count is inter- and intraobserver variable, whereas the automatic count performs reproducible cell colony counts, thereby minimizing user-generated bias. The large amount of data produced also gives information about cell and colony characteristics. Thus, this computer-assisted method has considerably improved the reliability of our statistical results.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}

To develop a digital method for counting colonies that highly replicates manual counting.


{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}

Breast cancer cells were treated with trastuzumab-conjugated gold nanoparticles in combination with X-ray irradiation, {(111)In} labeled trastuzumab, or γ-radiation, followed by clonogenic assays. Colonies were counted manually or digitally using {ImageJ} software with customized macros. Key parameters, intensity threshold and minimum colony size, were optimized based on three preliminary manual counts or blindly chosen. The correlation of digital and manual counting and inter- and intra-experimenter variability were examined by linear regression. Survival curves derived from digital and manual counts were compared by F-test {(P} {\textless} 0.05).


{RESULTS}

Using optimized parameters, digital counts corresponded linearly to manual counts with slope {(S)} and R(2) value close to 1 and a small y-intercept (y(0)): {SK-BR-3} {(S} = 0.96 ± 0.02, R(2) = 0.969, y(0) = 5.9 ± 2.2), {MCF-7/HER2-18} {(S} = 0.98 ± 0.03, R(2) = 0.952, y(0) = 0.74 ± 0.47), and {MDA-MB-231} cells {(S} = 1.00 ± 0.02, R(2) = 0.995, y(0) = 3.3 ± 4.5). Both reproducibility and repeatability of digital counts were better than the manual method. Survival curves generated from digital and manual counts were not significantly different; P-values were 0.3646 for {SK-BR-3} cells and 0.1818 for {MCF-7/HER2-18} cells. Using blind parameters, survival curves generated by both methods showed some differences: P-values were 0.0897 for {SK-BR-3} cells and 0.0024 for {MCF-7/HER2-18} cells.


{CONCLUSIONS}

The colony counting using {ImageJ} and customized macros with optimized parameters was a reliable method for quantifying the number of colonies.},

Pvclust can be used easily for general statistical problems, such as {DNA} microarray analysis, to perform the bootstrap analysis of clustering, which has been popular in phylogenetic analysis. Pvclust calculates probability values (p-values) for each cluster using bootstrap resampling techniques. Two types of p-values are available: approximately unbiased {(AU)} p-value and bootstrap probability {(BP)} value. Multiscale bootstrap resampling is used for the calculation of {AU} p-value, which has superiority in bias over {BP} value calculated by the ordinary bootstrap resampling. In addition the computation time can be enormously decreased with parallel computing option.

With the requirements of miniaturization, low-power, performance in order to provide some intelligent processing directly into the camera, embedded camera will dominate the image processing landscape in the future. While the common approach of developing such embedded systems is to use sequentially operating processors, image processing algorithms are inherently parallel, thus hardware devices like {FP-GAs} provide a perfect match to develop highly efficient systems. Unfortunately hardware development is more difficult and there are less experts available compared to software. Automatizing the design process will leverage the existing infrastructure, thus providing faster time to market and quick investigation of new algorithms. We exploit {ASP} (answer set programming) for system synthesis with the goal of genarating an optimal hardware software partitioning, a viable communication structure and the corresponding scheduling, from an image processing application.},

	abstract = {The clonogenic assay is the method of choice to determine cell reproductive death after in vitro irradiation treatment. Traditionally, colony quantification has been performed by manual counting, a very laborious, time-consuming and rather subjective task. In this study, we compared manual counting by two skilled investigators with automated counting using the freely available {ClonoCounter} program. Five human tumour cell lines were irradiated under normoxia (21\% O2) or anoxia ({\textless}0.1\% O2), after 24 h or 6 h anoxic preincubation. Colonies were quantified manually or using the {ClonoCounter} software. A positive correlation between the absolute number of colonies counted manually and automatically was shown. Though there was a general trend of underpredicting the absolute number of cell colonies when counting automatically, survival curves were very similar, and in none of the cell lines were significant differences in radiobiological parameters such as mean inactivation dose, surviving fraction at 2 Gy and oxygen enhancement ratio detected. Our results suggest that the {ClonoCounter} provides sufficient reliability to be implemented for counting human tumour colonies in in vitro irradiation experiments. In contrast to several previously reported computer-aided colony-counting methods, it is a freely available program, requiring only minimal instrument costs.},

	abstract = {Microscale technologies have emerged as a powerful tool for studying and manipulating biological systems and miniaturizing experiments. However, the lack of software complementing these techniques has made it difficult to apply them for many high-throughput experiments. This work establishes Arraycount, an approach to automatically count cells in microwell arrays. The procedure consists of fluorescent microscope imaging of cells that are seeded in microwells of a microarray system and then analyzing images via computer to recognize the array and count cells inside each microwell. To start counting, green and red fluorescent images (representing live and dead cells respectively), are extracted from the original image and processed separately. A template-matching algorithm, is proposed in which pre-defined well and cell templates are matched against the red and green images to locate microwells and cells. Subsequently, local maxima in the correlation maps is determined and local maxima maps are thresholded. At the end, the software records the cell counts for each detected microwell on the original image in high-throughput. The automated counting was shown to be accurate compared with manual counting, with a difference of {\textasciitilde}1–2 cells per microwell: based on cell concentration, the absolute difference between manual and automatic counting measurements was 2.5–13\%.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims Although many methods exist for quantifying the number of pollen grains in a sample, there are few standard methods that are user-friendly, inexpensive and reliable. The present contribution describes a new method of counting pollen using readily available, free image processing and analysis software.
Methods Pollen was collected from anthers of two species, Carduus acanthoides and C. nutans {(Asteraceae)}, then illuminated on slides and digitally photographed through a stereomicroscope. Using {ImageJ} {(NIH)}, these digital images were processed to remove noise and sharpen individual pollen grains, then analysed to obtain a reliable total count of the number of grains present in the image. A macro was developed to analyse multiple images together. To assess the accuracy and consistency of pollen counting by {ImageJ} analysis, counts were compared with those made by the human eye.
Key Results and Conclusions Image analysis produced pollen counts in 60 s or less per image, considerably faster than counting with the human eye (5–68 min). In addition, counts produced with the {ImageJ} procedure were similar to those obtained by eye. Because count parameters are adjustable, this image analysis protocol may be used for many other plant species. Thus, the method provides a quick, inexpensive and reliable solution to counting pollen from digital images, not only reducing the chance of error but also substantially lowering labour requirements.},

Drosophila is a widely used model organism for in vivo studies. However, counting neurons throughout the nervous system of the intact animal is humanly unfeasible. Automatic methods for cell counting in intact Drosophila are desirable. Here, we show a method called {DeadEasy} Neurons to count the number of neurons stained with anti-{HB9} antibodies in Drosophila embryos. {DeadEasy} Neurons employs image filtering and mathematical morphology techniques in {2D} and {3D}, followed by identification of nuclei in {3D} based on minimum volume, to count automatically the number of {HB9} neurons in vivo. The resultant method has been validated for Drosophila embryos and we show here how it can be used to address biological questions. Counting neurons with {DeadEasy} is very fast, extremely accurate, and objective, and it enables analyses otherwise humanly unmanageable. {DeadEasy} Neurons can be modified by the user for other applications, and it will be freely available as an {ImageJ} plug-in. {DeadEasy} Neurons will be of interest to the microscopy, image processing, Drosophila, neurobiology, and biomedical communities.},
